# Real-time Stock Tracking Application
## with Akka Typed Actors

This project began as a CSYE7200 team project and all the original work
can be found here https://github.com/khurshhh1999/Stock-Tracking-Application.git

The authors of the system are:
* Ankur Varma
* Khursheed Khan
* Kavish Daftri

This project is one of the very best team projects I've seen in 18 seminars.

The changes that will be made here are mostly to keep the software 
up to the latest versions, including a move to Scala 3.
The first commit of code is all exactly as I found it in the team project repository referenced above.
